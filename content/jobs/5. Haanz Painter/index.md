- As part of the site management team, I performed various tasks. In this team, I per-formed safety checks on working platforms, coordinated client service issues, and interacted with clients. I can also provide estimates for what customers want. To ensure the company is presented well, I work closely with my manager and provide him with regular feedback. I participate in site meetings heavily and provide infor-mation when necessary.
