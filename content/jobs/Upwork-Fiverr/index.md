My duties included designing interactive web apps for use by users using JavaScript based coding. Developed multiple web applications for a variety of purposes in collaboration with colleagues. I also created illustrations and user-facing features using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. In addition, I offered my latex typesetting services for technical documents. I often use latex since it allows me to create profes-sional-looking documents.
