It was imperative that I provide excellent customer service, which was acknowledged by customer feedback; one customer described me as 'very friendly and helpful'. Making sure customers have the best shopping experience by directing them to shorter queues. Managing cash and stock using procedures and policies. Keeping the workplace clean and tidy by following the cleaning rota. As a result of all the training I have received, I have received an award for 'best multitasker' after only a couple of weeks of working at the store.
