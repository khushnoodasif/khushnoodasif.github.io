As part of the site management team, I performed various tasks. In this I have worked at venues such as the O2 Arena, London Stadium, and Kia Oval. In this role, I gained expertise in security operations, crowd management, safety protocols, and working with law enforcement. I also assisted crowds if needed by communicating in Punjabi or Urdu.
