As an intern at CFTE, I gained a solid understanding of the fintech industry and knowledge of how fintech companies work, as well as collaboration opportunities with awesome peers from more than 50+ countries. I was also mentored by a great leader, David Haran. For the project, I conducted a case study on Chipper Cash - an alternative method of transferring money across the continent of Africa. Together with two other members, we created a detailed document and presentation. The culmination of my experience included amazing seminars with Mastercard, PayPal, GRAYCE, Onfido, and R3.
